GOTrack is a web-based system and database that provides access to historical records and trends in 
the Gene Ontology and GO annotations. The current production installation is accessible at https://gotrack.msl.ubc.ca/index.xhtml.

## Building from source

GOTrack uses Lombok (https://projectlombok.org/), a bytecode postprocessor. 
Follow the instructions from Lombok to configure it for your IDE.
